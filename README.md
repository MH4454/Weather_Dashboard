# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## General info

I developed a weather dashboard that shows the current weather, UV index, and forecast for the city based on the user input. A drop-down of previously searched cities is available, so the user would be able to re-search their favorite cities. Deployed Link: https://mh4454.github.io/Weather_Dashboard/

#### Personal notes

This project was a great learning experience for using APIs with AJAX.


## Task
Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.
